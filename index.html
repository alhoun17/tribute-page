            <article>
                
                <p id="article">Known professionally as Nipsey Hussle. Ermias Joseph Asghedom was born to Angelique Smith, an African-American woman, and Dawit Asghedom, an Eritrean immigrant, on August 15, 1985. He was raised in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Los Angeles with his brother Samuel and his sister Samantha. Asghedom attended Hamilton High School in the nearby Castle Heights neighborhood, but dropped out before graduating.</p>
                <p id="article">At the age of 14, Asghedom left home and joined the local Rollin 60's Neighborhood Crips, a sub-group of the larger Crips gang primarily based in his home neighborhood of Crenshaw. His stage name, a play on the name of comedian Nipsey Russell, originated as a nickname given to Asghedom by a childhood friend. At the age of 19, Asghedom's father took both him and his brother Samuel on a trip to Eritrea, East Africa for three months in 2004. Asghedom credited the trip with inspiring him to become a community activist with an "entrepreneurial spirit".</p>

                <p id="article">In December 2005, Hussle independently released his first mixtape, Slauson Boy Volume 1, to moderate local success.His debut project helped to build a small regional fanbase on the west coast, and eventually led to Hussle being signed to Cinematic Music Group and Epic Records. In 2008, Hussle released the first two installments in his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series of mixtapes, which helped to bring Hussle's music to a larger audience.</p>
                <p id="article">In 2009, he collaborated with Drake on the song "Killer", and also appeared, along with Snoop Dogg and Problem, on the song "Upside Down", from Snoop Dogg's 2009 album Malice n Wonderland.

The store is billed as a "smart store," which bridges the gap between culture and technology by giving customers access to exclusive music and other content created by rappers through an app created by software engineer Iddris Sandu</p>
